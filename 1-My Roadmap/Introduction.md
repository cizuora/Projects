üëãüèø, my name is Chidera Izuora. I am a Trainee Developer. I am at the beginning stage of my Computer Science journey. Right now, I am training to become a full-stack developer.  I have created a roadmap so that any future employer can see what I have learned and keep track of my skills. 

The folders are organized based on the personal roadmap I have laid out to become a full-stack developer. Some will include projects I have done for classes.
