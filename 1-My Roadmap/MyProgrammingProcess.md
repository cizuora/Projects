### **My Programming Process**

Developing a program is a systematic process, typically involving these steps:
1.  **Clearly define what the program is to do.** What problem will it solve?
2.  **Visualize the program running on the computer.** How will it interact with the user?
3.  **Use design tools to create a model of the program.** This might involve diagrams or pseudocode.
4.  **Check the model for logical errors.** Does the proposed solution make sense?
5.  **Enter the code and compile it.** Translate your design into a programming language.
6.  **Correct any errors found during compilation.** This step often involves repeating steps 5 and 6 until the code compiles successfully.
7.  **Run the program with test data for input.** See how the program behaves with actual data.
8.  **Correct any runtime errors found while running the program.** These are errors that only appear when the program is executing. This step may require repeating steps 5 through 8.
9.  **Validate the results of the program.** Ensure the program produces the correct output for various inputs.
