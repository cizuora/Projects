# Hi there 👋 I’m Chidera Izuora

I’m a Trainee Developer at the beginning of my Computer Science journey. Currently working toward becoming a Full-Stack Developer. Below you’ll find my roadmap, what I’ve learned so far, what I’m building, and how to reach me.

## 🚧 Projects & Experience

* My repo is organized according to my roadmap; folder names reflect stages in my learning.
* Some folders contain **school projects**; others are side projects I created to practice specific skills.
* As I complete more projects I will link to live demos, code examples, screenshots, etc.

---

## 🔍 Skills & Tools

Here are some of the tools, languages, and technologies I’m working with:

* **Languages**: Java, JavaScript
* **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, React
* **Back-End**: Node.js, Express
* **Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)
* **Other**: REST APIs, authentication (JWT, OAuth), testing, deployment, Docker, Git/GitHub

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

Right now I am focusing on:

* Building full-stack apps from front to back
* Deploying apps to production (Heroku / AWS)
* Writing tests (unit, integration, E2E)
* Deepening my knowledge of algorithms and data structures

## ⚡ Fun Fact

> “The road to mastery is always under construction.” I believe in continuous learning and building, no matter how small the project.

If you want, I can also format this README with badges (languages, tech stack), or suggest a visual layout / theme. Do you want me to build that out for you?
